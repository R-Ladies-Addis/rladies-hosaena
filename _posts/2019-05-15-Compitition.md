#### Coding for Innovation
Innovation does not come by coincidence. Structured approaches assist in
finding gaps that need and could be filled. These gaps might refer to needs and
desires of people, to manufacturing processes, to new materials, to new markets,
to new structures in organisations or to new products. Innovation requires to know
the people (customers and suppliers), the production processes, availability and
characteristics of materials, organisational structures and trends. Databases provide
descriptions. - The key is, how to read databases that needs, desires and wishes
